## Data Structure

The repository contains the implementation for domain adaptation using the LDP-Net model. The data structure for the source and target domains is as follows:

### Source Domain
- MiniImageNet: This dataset consists of images from various categories and is used as the source domain for domain adaptation.

### Target Domains
- Rabbit Breed: This dataset includes images of different rabbit breeds and serves as one of the target domains for domain adaptation.
- CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011): This dataset contains images of bird species and is used as another target domain for domain adaptation.

Please ensure that you download the necessary datasets and organize them properly within the corresponding source and target domain folders before running the code.
